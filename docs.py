    st.write("""
        Developers, let's dive into how nextPay facilitates cross-blockchain transactions within the EVM-based ecosystem. At the core of our cross-chain capability is a Solidity smart contract designed to handle token transfers securely and efficiently.

        Here's a quick overview of the smart contract:
        
        ```solidity
        // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
        pragma solidity ^0.8.8;

        contract TransferTokens {
            event Transfer(
                address indexed _from,
                address indexed _to,
                uint256 _amount,
                string _name,
                string _blockchain
            );

            function transferEther(
                address payable _to,
                string memory _name,
                string memory _blockchain
            ) external payable {
                require(_to != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");
                payable(_to).transfer(msg.value);
                emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, msg.value, _name, _blockchain);
            }

            function check() public pure returns (string memory) {
                return "Shashwat Singh";
            }
        }
        ```

        **How It Works:**
        - **Transfer Functionality:** The `transferEther` function is designed to facilitate the transfer of Ether from one address to another on the same blockchain. The function requires the recipient's address, a name string, and the blockchain identifier.
        - **Event Emission:** Each transfer triggers the `Transfer` event, which logs critical transaction details, including sender and recipient addresses, the amount transferred, and the blockchain involved.
        - **Cross-Blockchain Coordination:** While this contract operates on individual blockchains, nextPay coordinates transactions across different EVM-compatible blockchains by deploying similar contracts on each supported chain. The platform then links these transactions, enabling a seamless cross-chain transfer experience for users.
        - **Security Considerations:** By using a decentralized approach and requiring valid recipient addresses, the contract ensures that funds are securely transferred without vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
        
        **Customizability:** 
        - The contract's simplicity allows for easy customization to include additional features, such as transaction limits, multi-signature approvals, or integration with other smart contracts to expand functionality across the DeFi ecosystem.
        
        nextPay abstracts these technical details, providing users with a simple interface for cross-chain transfers while ensuring that the underlying process remains secure and efficient.

    st.write("""
        Let's dive into the technical aspects of Soundbox and how it operates behind the scenes to provide real-time transaction notifications. This feature is built using React and TypeScript, leveraging hooks and state management for optimal performance.

        **Core Components:**
        - **React Hooks:** We utilize `useEffect` and `useState` hooks to manage the component's lifecycle and state. The `useEffect` hook sets up event listeners for blockchain transactions, while `useState` tracks the type of blockchain and the transaction data.
        - **Blockchain Event Handling:** Each blockchain has a dedicated hook (e.g., `toTransferETH`, `toTransferBSC`) that establishes a connection to the corresponding smart contract. These hooks listen for `Transfer` events and update the state when a transaction is detected.
        - **Speech Synthesis API:** For delivering audio notifications, we use the Web Speech API‚Äôs `speechSynthesis` feature. When a transaction is detected, the `speak` function converts the event data into spoken words, ensuring the user receives immediate audio feedback.

        **Sample Code Explanation:**
        ```typescript
        const setupListener = async () => {
            const handleTransferEvent = (
                _from: string,
                _to: string,
                _amount: string,
                _name: string,
                _blockchain: string
            ) => {
                const message = `${_from} sent ${formatEther(_amount)} to ${_to} on ${_blockchain} blockchain with name ${_name}`;
                console.log('Event Data:', message);
                if (_to.toLowerCase() === accountName.toLowerCase()) {
                    setEventData({
                        from: _from,
                        to: _to,
                        amount: formatEther(_amount),
                        name: _name,
                        blockchain: _blockchain,
                    });
                }
            };

            const setupEventListener = async (getContract: any) => {
                const TransferTokenContract = getContract();
                console.log('Contract:', TransferTokenContract);

                await TransferTokenContract.on('Transfer', handleTransferEvent);
                contractEventListeners.push(() =>
                    TransferTokenContract.removeAllListeners('Transfer')
                );
            };

            if (type === 'ETH') {
                const { getContractETH } = toTransferETH();
                await setupEventListener(getContractETH);
            } else if (type === 'BSC') {
                const { getContractBSC } = toTransferBSC();
                await setupEventListener(getContractBSC);
            } //... (similar blocks for other blockchains)
        };
        ```

        **Explanation:**
        - **Event Listener Setup:** This function listens for `Transfer` events on various blockchains. When a transaction is detected, the event data (sender, recipient, amount, blockchain, etc.) is captured and logged. If the transaction involves the current user's account, it updates the state with this data.
        - **Dynamic Blockchain Selection:** Depending on the user's selected blockchain (`ETH`, `BSC`, `PLG`, etc.), the corresponding hook is used to get the contract instance and set up the event listener. This modular approach ensures that Soundbox can support multiple blockchains with minimal code duplication.
        - **Real-Time Audio Feedback:** Once the event data is captured, the `speak` function uses the SpeechSynthesis API to provide real-time audio feedback, ensuring users are promptly notified of transactions.

        **Why It Matters:**
        - **Efficiency:** By using modular hooks and centralized event handling, the system remains efficient and scalable, capable of supporting a wide range of blockchains with minimal overhead.
        - **Customization:** The use of hooks allows for easy customization and extension. Developers can add support for new blockchains by simply creating additional hooks and integrating them into the existing framework.
        - **User Experience:** The seamless integration of real-time audio notifications ensures that users are always in the loop, enhancing the overall user experience and providing peace of mind in managing digital assets.

        Soundbox is more than just a notification system‚Äîit's a robust, developer-friendly feature that adds tangible value to the nextPay platform. üöÄ

    - **Edge Over Them:** Transak excels in fiat on-ramps and KYC compliance, but nextPay goes beyond with cross-blockchain transactions and real-time notifications. Our zk-SNARK-based anonymous KYC provides superior privacy.

    ### **4. Circle (USDC) üíµ**
    - **What They Do:** Circle is the issuer of USDC, a leading stablecoin, and provides services like Circle Account and Circle APIs for businesses to integrate stablecoins into their operations.
    - **Edge Over Them:** Circle focuses on stablecoins and fiat-backed cryptocurrencies, whereas nextPay‚Äôs cross-blockchain payment gateway supports a broader range of EVM blockchains. Our Soundbox feature adds a real-time, interactive element that Circle‚Äôs offerings lack.

    ### **5. Trust Wallet üîí**
    - **What They Do:** Trust Wallet is a popular mobile wallet supporting a wide range of cryptocurrencies, allowing users to buy, store, and swap tokens, with in-app KYC for fiat-to-crypto purchases.
    - **Edge Over Them:** Trust Wallet primarily serves as a storage and swapping tool with limited cross-blockchain capabilities and real-time notifications. nextPay offers a comprehensive solution with a decentralized payment gateway, anonymous KYC, and the Soundbox, providing a richer platform for cross-blockchain functionalities.
